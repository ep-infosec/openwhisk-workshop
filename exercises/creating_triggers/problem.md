Complete the following tasks to finish the exercise.

- Manually invoke your trigger with the following parameters.

```
{
  "name": "Donald",
  "location": "New York"
}
```

This test verification assumes the last activation in the system is the
trigger firing. You can check the activation log with the following command.

```
