This exercise will test that you understand how to create OpenWhisk Actions
using the Swift runtime. Complete the following tasks to finish the exercise.

- Create an Action (hello-world-swift) which uses Swift runtime and returns the following message.

```
{
  "message": "Hello World"
}
```

- Create an Action (london-location-swift) that uses the Google Geocoding API 
  to return that latitude and longitude for London in the following format.

```
{
  "lat": 0.00,
  "lng": 0.00
}
```
